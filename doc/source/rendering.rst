Rendering
=========

The :cpp:class:`Scene` and :cpp:class:`Camera` classes can be used to
create synthetic seeded particle fields and render their images in
synthetic cameras which can in turn be used to calculate SA
reconstructed volumes or for other types of reconstructions such as
tomographic reconstruction.
